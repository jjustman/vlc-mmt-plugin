## Mar, 2021 Update:
We've developed an ExoPlayer plugin for MMT, including support for out-of-order mode with MFU depacketization here: 

https://github.com/jjustman/ExoPlayer_MMT_Plugin

# jjustman-2020-01-17 - this fork has been around for too long - please instead check out libatsc3 - https://github.com/jjustman/libatsc3 
At some point in the future, I may back-port in the MFU event callbacks into VLC for re-integration, but for now, please use the Android sample app for MMT playback

# jdj-2019-01-02 - adding support for ISO 23008-1 MMTP (Mpeg Media Transport Protocol) Demuxer for VLC.
